# Damped Newton method with a new linesearch

Developed by M. A. A. Bortoloti and T. A. Fernades


This is about the codes used in numerical simulations in [1]. We use these codes for solving two problems: a joint diagonalization problem and a problem of finding a zero of a non-conservative vector field. Please find "jointdiagonalizaztion" and "nonconservative" folders for access the Matlab codes. 

In [1] we present simulations of Algorithm 1 (Damped Newton with a new linesearch) and Algorithm 3 (Damped Newton method given in [2]).

Both codes can be started from Matlab file "driver.m" in each folder problem (jointdiagonalization or nonconservative).
